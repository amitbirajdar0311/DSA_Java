**Day 1: Diving into the Basics!** 🚀

Today, I kickstarted my 100 Days DSA Challenge by covering some fundamental topics:

1. **Flowchart & Pseudocode**:
   - **Flowchart**: Visual representation of the steps in a process. Helps in understanding the flow of an algorithm. I learned how to create and interpret different flowchart symbols such as process, decision, input/output, and connectors.
   - **Pseudocode**: A simplified, high-level version of programming code used to design algorithms. It bridges the gap between the human thought process and actual coding by outlining the logic in plain English.

2. **Variables & Data Types**:
   - **Variables**: Containers for storing data values. I explored how to declare and initialize variables, and how they hold different types of data.
   - **Data Types**: Different kinds of data that can be stored in variables. This includes primitive types like integers, floats, characters, and booleans, as well as more complex types like strings and arrays.

3. **Operators**:
   - **Arithmetic Operators**: Used for basic mathematical operations (e.g., +, -, *, /, %).
   - **Relational Operators**: Used to compare two values (e.g., ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=).
   - **Logical Operators**: Used to combine multiple conditions (e.g., &&, ||, !).
   - **Assignment Operators**: Used to assign values to variables (e.g., =, +=, -=).

4. **Conditional Statements**:
   - **If-Else Statements**: Allow for decision making in code based on conditions. I learned how to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false.
   - **Switch Statements**: A cleaner way to handle multiple conditions based on the value of a variable.

5. **Loops (Flow Control)**:
   - **For Loops**: Execute a block of code a specific number of times. Great for iterating over arrays or ranges.
   - **While Loops**: Continue executing a block of code as long as a condition is true.
   - **Do-While Loops**: Similar to while loops, but the block of code is executed at least once before the condition is tested.

📚 I've attached my detailed notes for each topic below.

A big thank you to #ShradhaDidi and #ApnaCollege for inspiring me to start this journey. 🙏
